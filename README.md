# EDA_WINES
The code was made by: Helen Navarro, Berta Pfaff, Sergio Salvador and myself (Marco Hernani)

Two exercises made during the Master in Data Science at Assembler Institute of Technology <br>
First exercise: The objective is to made an exploratory data analysis to some data about traffic fines in Madrid <br>
Second exercise: The objective is to made an exploratory data analysis to some data about wine scores around the world. <br>

The data used for the first exercise goes from 2014 to 2020. The data was actually stored in csv files that our teacher give us to make the task.

The data was taken from this webssite:

More information about the data found there.



Ideas for the future:
- Use more up-to-date data.
- Download by myself the data.
